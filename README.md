Acts as a switch and turns on the fan if it exceeds the threshold value.  
You'll need an `2n2222` transistor.  
Fan positive goes to GPIO 5V PIN.  
Fan ground goes to `collector`, GPIO PIN 12 goes to `base` and the GPIO ground goes to `emitter`.  
  
Readme will be updated with a more detailed and updated schematic later on.
